# Easy_Dynamic_Scraping

In this tutorial, I'll show how to scrape some informations relative to the car dealers in Portugal from the site: https://www.autonews.pt/.
The informations we want to scrape are: The name of the dealer shop, the car brands it sells, the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE coordinates and the postal code.
